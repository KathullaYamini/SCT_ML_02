# Customer Segmentation 🛍️📊

## Overview ℹ️

This project performs customer segmentation using machine learning techniques to group customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. The goal is to identify distinct customer profiles for targeted marketing strategies.

## Features 📊

- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: Customer's gender.
- **Age**: Customer's age.
- **Annual Income**: Yearly income of the customer.
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: A measure of customer spending behavior.

## Techniques Used 🛠️

- **K-Means Clustering**: Unsupervised learning for segmenting customers.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization tools for exploratory data analysis.

## Data 📈

The dataset `CustomerData.csv` contains demographic and purchasing information of customers. The data undergoes preprocessing before being used for clustering analysis.

## Methodology 🚀

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding relationships and patterns.
3. **Feature Scaling**: Normalizing data for clustering algorithms.
4. **Model Building**: Implementing K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
5. **Evaluation & Interpretation**: Analyzing the resulting customer segments.
